# JMIND

# Task:

âœ… Implementation in Golang.

âœ… Readable and structured code.

âœ… Use of standard and widely adopted libs, tools, and Go practices as much as possible.

âœ… Runtime-specific parameters (for example, external API key) can be passed to the service as a
  configuration without code changes. The configuration approach is up to you.
  
âœ… Unit tests of internal application logic.

âœ… If the service has dependencies (for example, database), provide a docker-compose file
so anyone can start the dependencies and test the implementation.

# Bonus points / nice to have:
âœ… Testing of the implemented endpoint on HTTP level. (file JMIND/TestAPI.http)

âœ… As accessing external data sources can be time consuming, consider some caching or persistent
storage for already requested blocks. 

ðŸ”² Integration testing of the implemented 3rd-party API client.

âœ… Graceful shutdown (if implemented right)
